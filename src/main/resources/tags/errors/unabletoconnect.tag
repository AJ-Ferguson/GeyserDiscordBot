issues: Unable to connect to world
---

**Unable to Connect to World** means that the Bedrock client cannot find the server specified. This is most likely not a Geyser issue itself, unless Geyser is not running.
There are various fixes for this on our wiki, please see [here](https://wiki.geysermc.org/geyser/fixing-unable-to-connect-to-world/).
