This "error" is caused by an login plug-in.

You can ask the developer of that plugin for how to solve this issue.
This is software piracy and is illegal!. By setting your server as so, you are condoning the use of piracy.

If you are simply just wanting Bedrock players to be able to join your Java server without a Java account, we recommend using our plugin [Floodgate](https://wiki.geysermc.org/floodgate/setup/) which allows them to join the server with it being in online mode. If you did not mean to set your server to offline mode or don't understand what it means, please read the above and set your server to online mode.
